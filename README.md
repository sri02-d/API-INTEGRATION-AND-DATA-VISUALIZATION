## USE PYTHON TO FETCH DATA FROM A PUBLIC API (E.G., OPENWEATHERMAP) AND CREATE VISUALIZATIONS USING MATPLOTLIB OR SEABORN . I CREATED A ACCOUNT IN OPEN WEATHER MAP WEBSITE AND GOT THE API KEY 

##Objective:
To understand how APIs work and how to integrate them using Python.

To fetch real-time data from a public API (OpenWeatherMap).

To process JSON data and extract useful information.

To visualize the extracted data using Pythonâ€™s powerful libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

To present the weather data in a user-friendly and graphical manner.

##Tools & Technologies Used:
Python: Main programming language used for scripting and data processing.

OpenWeatherMap API: Public API used to get real-time weather data.

Requests: Python library to handle HTTP requests and interact with APIs.

Matplotlib: Python library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, used for making statistical graphics in Python with ease.


##Output:
The script produces a neat bar chart that visually shows:

The temperature in degrees Celsius,

The humidity as a percentage,

The pressure in hPa (hectopascal).

This graphical representation provides a quick and intuitive understanding of the current weather condition of the selected city.

##Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the practical application of API integration and data visualization using Python. It showcases how real-time data can be accessed, processed, and presented in an insightful way. The integration of OpenWeatherMap API with visualization tools not only makes the output informative but also appealing to a non-technical audience.
